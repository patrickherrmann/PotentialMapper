This Java utility creates a visual representation of two dimensional data sets. A data point is defined as anything that has

*   a location defined in *x* and *y* coordinates, and
*   a positive or negative value.

The output is similar to a heat map. Each position on the two dimensional plan is shaded based on its proximity to data points.

Here is an example containing 40 random data points:

And another containing 400 random data points:
